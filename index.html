  <h1>Reading Part 7 – Cooking Experiences</h1>

      I've been having cookery classes at school, although I've somehow maintained an enthusiasm for making good food in spite of them! Luckily my mum, who's a pretty good cook herself, has always made my brother and me take turns in meal preparation, to ensure we learnt the essential skills. And those have been really useful for me in my classes, especially when we've had to improvise and make a meal using the very few things available to us there. That's really given me a good idea of what goes with what, and I'm much better at it now. And I've realised that to eat well, you have to learn how to cook well, and not just a few dishes either. Imagine you're a musician - people will get tired of hearing even a great song, if it's the only one you can play. That applies to cooking, too.

      I've always enjoyed watching my mum throw a collection of unlikely foods together and produce something really delicious. And after being made to stick to recipes in school cookery classes I've come to the conclusion that they should be seen as loose guidelines, and just trying things out is what matters. So I generally avoid them, especially when I'm baking, and just making a note of what I've done and what I've used to do it can take me a lot further - a bit like in my science classes! Still, it's great having someone like my mum around to explain exactly why the fluffy sponge cake I was aiming for has turned out to be a flat pancake. I rarely find the answers to my questions in cookbooks or online, however hard I try. Despite all that I've learnt, though, I'll never measure up to my mum's natural ability - but at least she's given me a real love of good food.

      My mum says she's such a good cook because she's spent so many years cooking for all of us. But I reckon the fact that she was the eldest child in a large household is the real reason for it. I enjoy helping out in the kitchen, making easy stuff like pasta for everyone. But I often mess up, like the time I was put in total charge of dinner and I dished up the pasta way before I'd even started making the sauce! Anyway, having an understanding family that puts up with it all has given me the confidence to experiment further. A couple of months ago, I decided to get a better understanding of different basic skills by shutting myself in my room with a cookery book, only returning to the kitchen when I thought I could manage a few key recipes perfectly - which I could!

      I had to be virtually dragged into the kitchen as a child to help out with getting meals on the table, so my mum certainly never imagined when I was young that I'd turn into an enthusiastic cook with some great recipes up my sleeve! But I'm always struck by how often I still make use of what I've learnt from her, whether that's making a soft sponge cake or making a little money go a long way. And I've realised for myself the value of great cookery books of the past - the methods written about in them are still used today. Mind you, my mum's horrified at the idea of me using a cookbook - unless it's one like hers, absolutely covered in her scribbled notes, and passed down through generations of our family!
