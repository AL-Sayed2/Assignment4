  <h1>Reading Part 6 â€“ AlphaGo</h1>

  <p>Recently, millions of people watched a man play a computer in a game called 'Go', one of the oldest board games in the world. The game involves two players placing black and white counters on a board, and gaining ground by 'capturing' their opponent's counters. It is thought to be the most complex game ever devised. A human-looking robot called AlphaGo, which was trained by a company called Deep Mind, played five games against Korean Lee Sodol, one of the world's leading players. Surprisingly, the computer won the opening game with ease.</p>

  <p>A fellow professional player of the game, Myung-wan Kim, was interviewed soon after the result was announced. He admitted that, although he had expected that the computer would perhaps manage to win a game at some point in the tournament, he never imagined that it was going to be the very first one. <strong>[37]</strong> <input type="text" maxlength="1" class="gap" /> However, it got considerably worse, as he went on to lose the next two games.</p>

  <p>The computer revealed its calculating nature towards the end of one of the games, when it appeared to have made a mistake that allowed Lee to capture several of AlphaGo's counters. <strong>[38]</strong> <input type="text" maxlength="1" class="gap" /> AlphaGo had thought ahead and made a clever tactical move. This proved it was capable of doing whatever would maximise its chances of ultimately winning. At this stage, Lee felt embarrassed about the fact that he was now losing 3-0 and stressed it was his personal defeat and not an indication that a computer like AlphaGo would always win against a human.</p>

  <p>Lee started to fight back in the middle of the fourth game by making some astonishing moves of his own, and spectators believed he might finally get his revenge. One of Lee's old rivals, who was in the audience, praised him for the quality of his performance. Meanwhile, the assembled journalists began to take notice, as AlphaGo seemed to be struggling. <strong>[39]</strong> <input type="text" maxlength="1" class="gap" /> This led some to speculate that the software was seriously malfunctioning.</p>

  <p>Lee was now minutes away from his first victory over AlphaGo, and was calm and fully focused at this crucial moment. <strong>[40]</strong> <input type="text" maxlength="1" class="gap" /> Then a message appeared on AlphaGo's screen confirming that it had conceded defeat for the first time.</p>

  <p><strong>[41]</strong> <input type="text" maxlength="1" class="gap" /> Instead, his focus was on the board and on the game he'd just won. In Go, it's customary to review the match with your opponent and to share your thoughts. Such a dialogue was not possible because across from Lee sat only the computer programmer, who was totally unable to explain the mistakes that AlphaGo had made on this occasion.</p>

  <p>Despite this setback for AlphaGo, the overall result was still a 3-1 win for the machine. It was a significant moment in the development of artificial intelligence. <strong>[42]</strong> <input type="text" maxlength="1" class="gap" /> This time, however, AlphaGo had learnt moves as a result of practical experience and had worked out the complex rules for itself - a very impressive achievement, as everyone acknowledged.</p>

  <h2>Options:</h2>
  <div class="options">
    <p>A. It was starting to make increasingly erratic and strange moves, which nobody could explain.</p>
    <p>B. Although it is quite advanced, it is only by trial and error that the machine can learn in this way.</p>
    <p>C. But if Lee was quietly congratulating himself for this victory, it was barely noticeable.</p>
    <p>D. Lee felt much the same, expressing disbelief that a mere machine could play the game so skilfully.</p>
    <p>E. In past experiments, computers had been programmed with information about the game before they faced their first human opponent.</p>
    <p>F. Meanwhile, the computer's programmer, who was responsible for moving counters on the board in response to instructions from the little machine, looked tense and worried.</p>
    <p>G. Lee thought this could be a turning point, but that was not the case.</p>
